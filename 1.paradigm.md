## Procedural Programming - 
Procedural programming is a programming paradigm where the program is structured around procedures or routines, which are sets of instructions that manipulate data.
Procedural programming is straightforward and well-suited for small to medium-sized programs, especially when the problem can be broken down into a sequence of steps. 

However, as programs grow in size and complexity, procedural programming can become hard to maintain and extend. Modifying one part of the code might have unintended consequences on other parts since the data is globally accessible, leading to potential bugs and difficulties in understanding the code base.
## Object-Oriented Programming - 
Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects." Objects are instances of classes, which are user-defined data types that encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) related to those objects. OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities and their interactions in a structured manner.
