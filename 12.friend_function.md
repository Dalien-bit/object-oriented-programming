## Friend Function

This is a function which is able to access the private data members of a class to which it is a friend of.


```
class Something {
  int x, y;

public:
  Something() : x(0), y(0) {}
  Something(int x, int y) : x(x), y(y) {}

  friend void func(Something &smth);
};

void func(Something &smth) {
  cout << "func can access private data " << smth.x << " " << smth.y << "\n";
}
```
