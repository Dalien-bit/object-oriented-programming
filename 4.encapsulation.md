## Encapsulation
1. It is a property of object oriented programming which ensures binding of related methods and variables into a single unit (class).
2. It is achieved by making the data accessible to only from the class methods.
3. It leads to abstarction
4. Class is an abstract data type


```
class Teacher {
  int salary;

public:
  string name, subject;

  Teacher(string n, string sub, int sal) {
    name = n;
    subject = sub;
    salary = sal;
  }

  void setSalary(int sal) {
    salary = sal;
  }

  int getSalary() {
    return salary;
  }
};
```
