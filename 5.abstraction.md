## Abstraction
It is a concept of object oriented programming that enables us to display only the useful information while hiding unnecessary/complex details (such as implementation).

e.g. in C++ the function -  
```pow(x, y)``` 
We know that this gives x to the power y but we dont know how it is implemented and we don't need to know it for using it.
