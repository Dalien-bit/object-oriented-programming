## Polymorphism

Ability of objects/methods to take different forms.

A real life example -
The word "right" can have multiple meanings
Right / Wrong
Right / Left
Depending on the usage

In object oriented programming polymorphism allows objects and methods to take different forms and the form taken is decided at either compile time or run time. Based on that we have two types of polymorphism

- Compile time polymorphism
- Run time polymorphism

<table>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr>
    <th> 
      <h3> Compile time polymorphism </h3>
    </th>
    <th>
      <h3>Run time polymorphism </h3>
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Acheievd through function overloading, operator overloading 
    </th>
    <th>Acheievd through function overriding</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Function name should be same but parameters can be different (function overloading)
    </th>
    <th>
      Function name and parameters should be same (function overriding)
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Faster execution</th>
    <th>Slower execution compared to compile time polymorphism</th>
  </tr>
